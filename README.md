# Severell Framework (In Development)

Severell is a web application framework designed to make developing web apps in Java fun and easy.
We have built a great starting point for you to just dive straight into developing your application. 

### Installation
*Severell is currently in development and I don't recommend using it yet unless you want play around or contribute
to it's development*. 

First you need to download the Severell CLI tool and put it in your path. You can download the binary over here https://github.com/mitchdennett/severell-cli/releases/download/0.0.1-alpha/severell-cli
. It has only been tested on MacOS right now. 

Run `severell-cli` to make sure you have installed it correctly. 

### Getting Started

Next you can run `severell-cli create myapp` to create a new Maven project and then import it into your favorite IDE as a maven project. I recommend IntelliJ since
that is what I use. I have not tried it in Eclipse yet. 

Compile and run your application.
